  I grew up in Southern California. I've been married for 33 years and have raised 5 beautiful daughters. I'm now taking a turn in my career path and have decided to learn to code. I don't have any experience as yet but I am in the process of taking courses at Codefellows. Im excited for the adventure to come!
